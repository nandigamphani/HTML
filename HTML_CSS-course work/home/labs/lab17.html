<h1>RISKS AND PRECAUTIONS OF USING WI-FI HOTSPOT.</h1>


    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_twin_(wireless_networks)" target="_blank">EVIL TWINS:</a>     

<p>
An evil twin, in security, is a rogue wireless access point that masquerades as a legitimate Wi-Fi access point so that an attacker can gather personal or corporate information without the end-user's knowledge.
</p>
<h3>Precautions to avoid Evil Twins:</h3>
<p>
To the end-user, the evil twin looks like a hot spot with a very strong signal; that's because the attacker has not only used the same network name and settings as the "good twin" he is impersonating, he has also physically positioned himself near the end-user so that his signal is likely to be the strongest within range. If the end-user is tempted by the strong signal and connects manually to the evil twin to access the Internet, or if the end-user's computer automatically chooses that connection because it is running in promiscuous mode, the evil twin becomes the end-user's Internet access point, giving the attacker the ability to intercept sensitive data such as passwords or credit card information.

<p>
Wi-Fi eavesdropping has long been a security concern. Anyone with a Wi-Fi-equipped laptop can download free Wi-Fi monitoring programs. An eavesdropper can sit up to 100 feet away and monitor what you do on the Net, says Rick Farina, security engineer for wireless security firm AirTight Networks.

<h3>Precautions to avoid hacking your system:<br><br>1-->Password strategies

</h3>
<p>
A strong, random password, changed often, is an important defense, Clark said. Skip using any known dictionary words and make passwords as many characters as a site will allow, he said. Use a password manager to store, generate and remember the passwords for you, but you will need one "really good master password" to unlock it, he said.
</p>
<h3>2-->Disable WiFi adapters by default</h3>
<p>
In other words, keep Wi-Fi shut off until it is needed, change the default settings on the device to disable Wi-Fi, 
forcing users to turn it on when needed. That way users are kept in the know, at least when they are actively using a Wi-Fi hotspot.
</p>
<h3>3-->Using a VPN</h3>
<p>
Perhaps that is a no brainer, but many organizations still leave some applications open to non-encrypted traffic to ease mobile worker woes.
 However, that ease of use can come at a high price, one where data can be intercepted and corporate resources infiltrated. 
 The simple solution here is to make sure all corporate resources can only be accessed remotely via a VPN connection.
 While that may require a user to log in numerous times (first into the hotspot, then into the VPN and then into the application),
 VPNs can protect data from interception and networks from compromise.
