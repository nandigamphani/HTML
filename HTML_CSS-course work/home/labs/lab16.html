         <h2>AARON PEIRSOL</h2> 
        
        <p>Peirsol was one of the stars of the USA swim team at Athens 2004, scoring a 100m/200m backstroke double and picking up another gold medal in the men’s 4x100m medley.
        Four years later in Beijing he retained his 100m backstroke title and won gold again in the men’s 4x100m medley relay, though he was second best to compatriot Ryan Lochte in the 200m backstroke.His overall medal haul from his three appearances in the Games was five golds and two silvers.The backstroke specialist collected a host of medals at each of the five world championships he competed in between 2001 and 2009, winning the world title in the 200m backstroke, 100m backstroke and 4x100m medley relay on four separate occasions.During his illustrious career, which also saw him compete in several editions of the Pan-American and Pan-Pacific Games, he amassed a total of 36 medals at major competitions, 29 of them gold</p>

           <h2>USAIN BOLT</h2>
         
         <ol>
         <li>A brilliant junior athlete, Bolt made his Olympic debut as a 17-year-old at Athens 2004, where, hampered by a torn hamstring, he went out in the opening round of the 200m.</li>
         <li>By the time he returned to the Games at Beijing four years later, the tall Jamaican sprinter was a firm favourite to claim an Olympic sprint double, having set a new 100m world record of 9.72 seconds in late May in New York, followed by the fastest 200m of the year, 19.67, a few weeks later in the Greek capital</li>
         <li>Taking to the track at the Bird’s Nest in his distinctive gold spikes, Bolt duly etched his name in track and field history, trimming his world record to 9.69 and winning the 100m at a canter, so much so that he was celebrating victory with arms outstretched 20 metres from the line</li>
         <li>Another gold and another world record followed in the 200m, with the Jamaican clocking 19.30 to eclipse Michael Johnson’s time at Atlanta 1996</li>
         <li>A third gold and a third world record followed in the 4x100m relay, Bolt running a lightning-fast final bend as he, Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Asafa Powell clocked 37.10 between them.
