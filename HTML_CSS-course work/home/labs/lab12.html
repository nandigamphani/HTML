				<h1>Homeland Security suspends travel ban</h1>
				<img src="https://images.alphacoders.com/612/612632.jpg">
				<p style="color:black; text-shadow:10px 10px 8px black;">President Donald Trump's government moved swiftly Saturday to comply with a federal judge's order halting his travel ban -- even as Trump himself denounced the judge -- but readied its legal defense of the controversial executive action.The Department of Homeland Security announced it has suspended all actions to implement the immigration order and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban. But it said the Justice Department -- which is expected to file an emergency motion to stop the order -- needed to challenge the ruling "at the earliest possible time."President Donald Trump's government moved swiftly Saturday to comply with a federal judge's order halting his travel ban -- even as Trump himself denounced the judge -- but readied its legal defense of the controversial executive action.The Department of Homeland Security announced it has suspended all actions to implement the immigration order and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban.

				<h1 class="head">My Opinion</h1><p>
				The nation was in widespread uncertainty over the controversial ban.This order adversely affects residents in areas of education,employment,education and freedom to travel;these affects are significant and ongoing.The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United states,prompted protests across the United States and led to multiple court challenges.In my opinion,though president's order is intended to protect the country ,he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the american people; but the approach to achieve it is not correct.I support Judge's order to halt this travel ban and hope it will eliminate all current chaos.
