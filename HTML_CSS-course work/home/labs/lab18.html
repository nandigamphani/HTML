   <h2>RESONS FOR FACEBOOK ADDICTION</h2> 
    <p class="flex-container">The reduction of boredom is a common reason people give for using Facebook. For some, the convenience of single, easy-to-use resource for news, games, and social interaction becomes the "go-to" activity whenever boredom arises.  
.Facebook users report that they use it to feel better when they are depressed, stressed, or anxious. The boost in mood may come from the previously discussed points of feeling more connected, understood, and important to others. When used only occasionally as an outlet for negative emotions, this may be relatively harmless - it would be naive to think that online support is not "real" or cannot be helpful. However, if turning to Facebook is one's primary method of dealing with stress, depression, low self-esteem, anger or other negative emotions this is clearly not healthy and dependence on this method of mood management could contribute to Facebook Addiction.Psychologist Abraham Maslow once proposed a hierarchy of human needs. In order of importance these were 1. Physiological Needs, 2. Security Needs, 3. Social Needs, 4. Esteem Needs, and 5. Self-Actualizing Needs. Most relevant to our discussion on Facebook Addiction are the Social Needs made up of the sub-needs for belonging, love, and affection. He suggested that social needs are fulfilled though relationships with friends, family, romantic relationships, and other attachments. It is very easy to see how part of the appeal of Facebook is that it makes filling these social needs much easier compared to the effort that would be required for in-person contact. Of note, the "friends commenting on my life" structure of Facebook also addresses Esteem Needs (believing in personal worth and gaining social recognition). If it did not provide a method for gaining Social Needs and Esteem Needs, would anyone become addicted to Facebook? .Not only does Facebook appeal to our need for social connections and friendships, it is increasingly becoming one of the world's most popular destinations for online gaming. Not surprisingly, Facebook tends to focus games that emphasize online social interactions with other players - which is often recognized as one of the factors that can encourage excessive play and contribute to video game addiction.

    <h2>ARTICLE ABOUT A PERSON ADDICTED TO FACEBOOK</h2>
    <p class="flex-container">The woman who was so distracted by Facebook that she walked off a pier into icy waters::--
A female tourist visiting Australia has put a new spin on taking a long walk off a short pier. She was so intent on checking Facebook that she plunged straight into chilly waters of Port Phillip Bay. Fortunately for her there were witnesses who quickly alerted the police.
<br>
Not only was this particular tourist completely unaware of her surroundings — she also reportedly couldn't swim. Luckily for her, Port Philip is quite shallow for the most part, and she wound up just 60 feet away from the pier where she was quickly rescued and taken to a local hospital.
<br>
The most surprising part? She didn't lose her phone. Even though she couldn't swim and the water temperature was around freezing, she clung tightly to her precious mobile during the whole ordeal.

    <h2>HOW CAN PEOPLE MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOUR</h2>
    <p class="flex-container">1) Admit that Facebook addiction disorder may be something you need to address. Although "admitting that you have a problem" definitely qualifies as a cliché at this point, it remains true that you must recognize that a problem exists before you will be motivated to do something about it. 
<br>
2) Not sure if you are addicted to Facebook or if it is causing significant problems in your life? Complete the 30-item Facebook Addiction Test right here at TechAddiction to find out.
<br>
3) Keep track of just how much time you are spending on Facebook. Keep the list next to your computer (take it with you if you are on Facebook at work, school, or other places). Take note of how often you log on, how long you stay connected, and what you are doing (e.g., posting, commenting, reading news, games, etc). If you want to beat Facebook addiction you need to know just how much of a problem it is. 
<br>
4) Ask significant others (close friends, family) how they feel about the amount of time you spend on Facebook. Ask them for honest feedback, be prepared to listen, and try not to be defensive. Do they believe that you are addicted to Facebook? Would your relationship with this person improve if were able to cut back on the time you spend on Facebook? 
        <br>
    5) Set a predetermined amount of time allowed for Facebook per day. For most people, 60 - 90 minutes per day is more than enough time to catch up with others, read your news feeds, and make few posts yourself. You may choose to break this time up throughout the day (e.g. 30 minutes in the morning, 60 minutes at night) as long as you stay within your limits. As you attempt to beat Facebook addiction you may find it helpful to slowly reduce your permitted time over the course of a month until you reach your time goals. 
<br>
6) When you log on to Facebook, set an external reminder for your allotted time. This may be a timer on your computer, a reminder from a friend or family member, or a physical timer sitting right next to you. When your time expires, log off - no exceptions!
