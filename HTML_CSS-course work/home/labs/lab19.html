     <h2>The rice</h2>
     <h3>The temperature is wrong:</h3>
     <p>Sushi rice should be served close to body temperature and kept slightly warm until being served. That's not happening in a grocery store.</p>
     <h3>The rice loses its integrity:</h3>
     <p>Decent sushi chefs don't view the rice as one ring of starch, they think of each grain as separate. Over time those grains of rice cease to be unique snowflakes and conform into one bland snowman.</p>

     <h2>The fish</h2>
     <h3>Seasonality isn't taken into account:</h3>
     <p>Fish have different life cycles, so some will taste best at certain times of the year. A good sushi chef knows what's in season and will recommend it, whereas at grocery stores it's always spicy tuna season.</p>

     <h2>Sauces</h2>
     <h3>The soy sauce isn't custom:</h3>
     <p>Like ginger, a legit sushi chef is probably using a custom blend of soy sauce that doesn't come out of a miniature packet.</p>
     <h3>The wasabi isn't fresh:</h3>
     <p>The spice and flavor of real wasabi disappears within 10 or 15 minutes of grinding, so there's no way you're getting the real stuff.</p>
     <h3>Grocery store sushi is oxidized</h3>
     <p>The point of cutting sushi just before serving is that meat oxidizes when exposed to air, and the flavor deflates. No amount of loosely fitting plastic cover can keep that fish from turning sour once it's been cut.</p>
