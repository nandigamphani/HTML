<p><font size="4" color="#DC143C">I like RetaiMeNot because the website is organized.It is easy to use.The website is well designed.If we select a particular store for coupons ,It shows us different options if we want to use the coupons code online or in-store.The home page has all the best deals going on on it.It also shows us the recommendations based on the previous searches.</font></p>

    <a style="font-size:25px;" href="http://www.deals2buy.com/" title="Link to deals2buy" target="_blank"><strong>Deals2buy</strong></a>
</p>
    <br>
<p><font size="4" color="#DC143C">I dislike Deals2buy because it doesn't fit with the business objective and overlooks the target market.The design of the website is not attractive.It has many products which are unorganized.There is no clear description of the products.The items in the website are not categorized.Homepage is not eye grabbing.</font></p>
