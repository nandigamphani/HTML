Builds problem-solving and motor skills offers stress relief.Promotes to have an optimistic attitude.You become more observant to the details.Aside from improving mental and emotional capabilities,it helps me enjoy improved sensory and motor skills through constant painting and drawing.Knowing the difficulties that are offered by life, it would be nice to occasionally take some time off, lift a paintbrush or pencil, and start painting or drawing.</p>
